# odin-recipies
This is a website that contains three recipies, their descriptions, instructions, and images that detail what they look like.

In this website I have used HTML relative linking to pages in the parent, sibling, and child directories. Created unordered and ordered lists to detail ingredients and cooking directions. Linked photo's relatively in each of the recipe files. A navigation system on the homepage to the recipies and navigation in the recipies to go back to the homepage. Additionally adding header, footer, and menu elements to lay foundation for a robust navigation system.
